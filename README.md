NBAplayRs: A package to measure an individual’s performance in the NBA

The goal of this package is to help measure an individual’s performance in the NBA. This is a tricky task as there are various compounding factors that could affect a player’s performance, such as: which team they are playing, who was guarding them, who from their team is on the court with them, etc. This package finds a way to remove these and compares their performance to the league’s average. Furthermore, the NBA season has two parts: regular season and post season. The post season is a tournament to see who wins the championship of the year. This package will create a method to compare a player’s performance in the regular season compared to the post season to see if they do better in either one.

One can download this package via github by using the following code once completed:
devtools::install_github("MattBlack9/NBAplayRs")
