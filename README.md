NBAplayRs: A package to measure an individual’s performance in the NBA

The goal of this package is to help measure an individual’s performance in the NBA. This is a tricky task as there are various compounding factors that could affect a player’s performance, such as: which team they are playing, who was guarding them, who from their team is on the court with them, etc. This package finds a way to remove these and compares their performance to the league’s average. Furthermore, the NBA season has two parts: regular season and post season. The post season is a tournament to see who wins the championship of the year. This package will create a method to compare a player’s performance in the regular season compared to the post season to see if they do better in either one.

The planned functions include: a web scraping function, calculation of individual player performance function, graphing of a player’s performance compared to another, and a model that compares a player’s regular season performance to their post season performance. The required inputs will vary depending on the functions, but a player’s seasons stats, player’s individual performance, and a team’s performance will be required inputs. Outputs will include a player’s summary of every season they played in, multiple graphics, and a measure of how they did in the regular season compared to the post season.
